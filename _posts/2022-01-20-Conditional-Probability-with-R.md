In this post, we will explore conditional probability and how it relates
to Bayes’ Theorem.

Conditional Probability
-----------------------

Conditional probability is the likelihood of an event or outcome
occurring based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome. Below
is the equation for the conditional probability.

$P(A\|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B) }{P(B)}$

where:

*P*(*A* ∩ *B*) is the probability that event A and event B both occur.

*P*(*B*) is the probability that event B occurs.

For example:

-   Event A is a person completing their projects on time in a year.
    There is 85% chance that this person will complete their work on
    time.
-   Event B is that this person receiving a raise at the end of the
    year. Raises are only given to to 45% of those that complete their
    work on time in a year.  
-   P(complete work and raise) = P(raise\|complete work) P(complete
    work) = 0.45 \* 0.85 = 0.3825

Looks like working hard does pay off. Conditional probability implies
there is a relationship between these two events, such as the
probability as completing your work on time in a year, and receiving a
raise. In other words, conditional probability depends on a previous
result. In this case, it is the probability of completing your work on
time.

Let’s take a look at a survey given to male and female students and
asking what their favorite past times are. Below a prepared a function
`rng_survey()` to generate the survey answers.

``` r
#helper function for our survey
rng_survey <- function(max, n){ 
  #max is the maximum number of surveys for a participant group (ie. Male)
  #n is the number of possible answers
  total = 0
  while (total != max){
    x <- sample(1:max, n, replace = TRUE)
    total = sum(x)
  }
  return(x)
}
```

``` r
#male = rng_survey(150,4)
#female = rng_survey(150,4)
#cat("male answers:", male, "\n") 
#cat("female answers:", female, "\n") 

#male answers: 7 19 26 98 
#female answers: 7 69 40 34 
```

Using the function, we create a data frame with the survey answers.

``` r
#create data frame for the survey responses
df <- data.frame(gender=rep(c('Male', 'Female'), each=150),
                 sport=rep(c('Exercise', 'Cooking', 'Reading', 'Television',
                             'Exercise', 'Cooking', 'Reading', 'Television'),
                              times=c(7, 19, 26, 98, 7, 69, 40, 34 )))
df
```

    ## 297 Female Television
    ## 298 Female Television
    ## 299 Female Television
    ## 300 Female Television

We convert the data frame to a table.

``` r
#create two-way table from data frame
survey_data <- addmargins(table(df$gender, df$sport))

survey_data
```

    ##         
    ##          Cooking Exercise Reading Television Sum
    ##   Female      69        7      40         34 150
    ##   Male        19        7      26         98 150
    ##   Sum         88       14      66        132 300

We can extract information from our table by calling a row and a column.
For instance, let’s ask for the number of males that prefer cooking.

``` r
survey_data['Male', 'Cooking']
```

    ## [1] 19

Now we can ask the probability of being male given that they prefer
cooking. We know that the probability of being male is `0.5`. We can
calculate the rest from the table.

``` r
P_male = 0.5
P_cooking_male = survey_data['Male', 'Cooking'] / survey_data['Male', 'Sum'] #probability of only males that prefer cooking

P_male_P_cooking_male = P_male * P_cooking_male
P_cooking = survey_data['Sum', 'Cooking'] / survey_data['Sum', 'Sum'] #probability of male and female that prefers cooking

P_male_cooking =  P_male_P_cooking_male / P_cooking

P_male_cooking #probability of being male given they prefer cooking
```

    ## [1] 0.2159091

Alternatively, we can use the table to easily answer the same problem.

``` r
survey_data['Male', 'Cooking'] / survey_data['Sum', 'Cooking'] 
```

    ## [1] 0.2159091

Next, we can ask the probability of being female given that they prefer
reading.

``` r
survey_data['Female', 'Reading'] / survey_data['Sum', 'Reading']
```

    ## [1] 0.6060606

Bayes’ Theorem
--------------

Suppose that we have the same survey but male and female was not
recorded by accident. How could we solve the probability of being male
given that they prefer cooking? Let us assume from a previous survey we
knew that 12.67% of males prefer to cook or is the probability of
preferring to cook given that they are male. We can use something called
Bayes’ Theorem,

$P(A\|B) = \\frac{P(B\|A) P(A) }{P(B)}$.

Bayes’ Theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior
knowledge of conditions that may be related to the event.

Knowing that the equation for conditional probability is

$P(A\|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B) }{P(B)}$

then

*P*(*A* ∩ *B*) = *P*(*A*\|*B*)*P*(*B*)

and

*P*(*A* ∩ *B*) = *P*(*B*\|*A*)*P*(*A*).

We can solve for *P*(*A* ∩ *B*) with substitution to yield

$P(A\|B) = \\frac{P(B\|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$.

``` r
#view table
survey_data
```

    ##         
    ##          Cooking Exercise Reading Television Sum
    ##   Female      69        7      40         34 150
    ##   Male        19        7      26         98 150
    ##   Sum         88       14      66        132 300

``` r
P_male = 0.5
P_cooking_male = 0.1267 #probability of prefering to cook given that they are male
P_cooking = survey_data['Sum', 'Cooking'] / survey_data['Sum', 'Sum'] #probability of male and female that prefers cooking

P_male_cooking =  (P_cooking_male * P_male) / P_cooking

P_male_cooking #probability of being male given they prefer cooking
```

    ## [1] 0.2159659

Let’s try to solve for the reverse, the probability of preferring to
cook given that they are male, using Bayes’ Theorem.

``` r
P_male_cooking * P_cooking / P_male
```

    ## [1] 0.1267

Is there a way to solve for the probability of preferring to cook given
that they are female using Bayes’ Theorem?

``` r
P_female = 1 - P_male #We have a binary choice and the probabilities sum up to 1
P_female_cooking = 1 - P_male_cooking
P_female_cooking * P_cooking / P_female
```

    ## [1] 0.4599667

Looking back at the table, we can use Bayes’ Theorem to solve this
problem.

``` r
survey_data['Female', 'Cooking'] / survey_data['Female', 'Sum']
```
