<h2>Introduction</h2>
When going to school, you have a teacher or mentor that will dedicate their time to teach and mentor you. As a working professional, you may run into new ideas and concepts that you do not understand. However, no one may be available to teach you. This is where a framework for self-study is important. Everyone has their own way of learning through self-study. Here I will use this post to describe my framework in words. This is to keep a record for myself, reflect upon my self-study methods, and provide a foundation for future self-learners. 
<h2>Autodidacticism</h2>
From wikipedia,
> Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) or self-education (also self-learning and self-teaching) is education without the guidance of masters (such as teachers and professors) or institutions (such as schools). 
> Generally, autodidacts are individuals who choose the subject they will study, their studying material, and the studying rhythm and time.
