## Danh D. Truong

Biomedical Engineering PhD 

I’m an Assistant Professor at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I investigate mesenchymal tissue differentiation as a framework for understanding the phenotypic plasticity of soft tissue and bone sarcomas. My research interests span cancer biology, cellular reprogramming, and the application of machine learning to uncover hidden patterns in tumor behavior. Outside the lab, I’m an avid reader—my favorite book series is The Expanse, though I also deeply enjoy The Lord of the Rings and The Legend of Drizzt for their rich world-building and character depth.
