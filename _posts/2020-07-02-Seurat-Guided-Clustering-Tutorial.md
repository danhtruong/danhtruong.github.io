While the vignette on the Seurat website already provides good
instructions, I will be using this to give additional thoughts and
details that could help beginners to Seurat. In addition, I will provide
some recommendations on the workflow as well.

<h2>
Loading the files
</h2>
The first thing the tutorial asks you to do is download the raw data
from [10x
Genomics](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/10x.files/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz){:target="_blank"}.
The raw data contains three key files within it: barcodes.tsv,
genes.tsv, and matrix.mtx. You will also notice they are contained in a
folder called hg19. That simply means the counts were generated using
the hg19 genome (Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37)) as
the reference transcriptome.

Let’s load in each of the files and take a look at them.

``` r
barcodes <- read.table("data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/barcodes.tsv")
head(barcodes)
```

    ##                 V1

    ## 2 AAACATTGAGCTAC-1
    ## 3 AAACATTGATCAGC-1
    ## 4 AAACCGTGCTTCCG-1
    ## 5 AAACCGTGTATGCG-1
    ## 6 AAACGCACTGGTAC-1

``` r
genes <- read.delim("data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/genes.tsv", header=FALSE)
head(genes)
```

    ## 6 ENSG00000237683   AL627309.1

``` r
library(Matrix)
mat <- readMM(file = "data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/matrix.mtx")
mat[1:5, 1:10]
```

    ## 5 x 10 sparse Matrix of class "dgTMatrix"

    ## [1,] . . . . . . . . . .
    ## [2,] . . . . . . . . . .
    ## [3,] . . . . . . . . . .
    ## [4,] . . . . . . . . . .
    ## [5,] . . . . . . . . . .

You will notice when we take a look at the matrix file, it contains `.`.
These are used when no count is detected rather using a value of 0. This
is called a sparse matrix to reduce memory and increase computational
speed. It is pretty much standard to work using sparse matrices when
dealing with single-cell data.

<h2>
Generating the Seurat Object
</h2>
Next, we will generate a `Seurat` object based on the files we loaded up
earlier.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(Seurat)
library(patchwork)

# Load the PBMC dataset
pbmc.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/")
# Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data).
pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = "pbmc3k", min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)
```

    ## Warning: Feature names cannot have underscores ('_'), replacing with dashes
    ## ('-')

``` r
pbmc
```

    ## An object of class Seurat 
    ## 13714 features across 2700 samples within 1 assay 
    ## Active assay: RNA (13714 features, 0 variable features)

<h2>
Pre-processing the data
</h2>
Now we will pre-process the data and perform quality control on the
cells. There are a couple of metrics that are used within the community.

-   The number of unique genes detected in each individual cell.
    -   Low-quality cells or empty droplets will often have very few
        genes.
    -   Sometimes this could be ambient mRNA that is detected.
    -   Cell doublets or multiplets may exhibit an aberrantly high gene
        count. There are some additional packages that can be used to
        detect doublets.
-   The percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome
    -   Low-quality / dying cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial
        contamination.
    -   This is often calculated by searching for genes containing `MT-`

``` r
# The [[ operator can add columns to object metadata. This is a great place to stash QC stats
pbmc[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = "^MT-")
```

Let’s take a look at the metadata which includes some of the QC metrics.

-   `nCount_RNA` is the number of unique counts in each cell.
-   `nFeature_RNA` is the number of unique genes in each cell.
-   `percent.mt` is the mitochondrial mapping that we just calculated.

``` r
head(pbmc@meta.data, 5)
```

    ##                  orig.ident nCount_RNA nFeature_RNA percent.mt
    ## AAACATACAACCAC-1     pbmc3k       2419          779  3.0177759
    ## AAACATTGAGCTAC-1     pbmc3k       4903         1352  3.7935958
    ## AAACATTGATCAGC-1     pbmc3k       3147         1129  0.8897363
    ## AAACCGTGCTTCCG-1     pbmc3k       2639          960  1.7430845
    ## AAACCGTGTATGCG-1     pbmc3k        980          521  1.2244898

Seurat recommends a threshold for filtering for the QC metrics.

-   Cells are filtered for unique feature counts over 2,500 or less
    than 200
-   Cells are filtered for &lt;5% mitochondrial counts

``` r
# Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), ncol = 3)
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Seurat-Guided-Clustering-Tutorial_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

We can take a look and see that the unique counts and feature are
correlated. In addition, we see that low counts appear to correlate with
high mitochondrial mapping percentage.

``` r
# FeatureScatter is typically used to visualize feature-feature relationships, but can be used
# for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in object metadata, PC scores etc.

plot1 <- FeatureScatter(pbmc, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "percent.mt")
plot2 <- FeatureScatter(pbmc, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "nFeature_RNA")
plot1 + plot2
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Seurat-Guided-Clustering-Tutorial_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

I find that the density plots provide a better visualization of the
distributions in case you may have a bimodal distribution.

``` r
# Visualize QC metrics as ridge plots
RidgePlot(pbmc, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), ncol =1)
```

Let’s use an adaptive threshold rather than fixed threshold. This
provides a more elegant method of detecting the thresholds rather than
by eye using the graphs. First, we assume that most of the cells are
high-quality. Next, we then identify cells that are outliers using the
median absolute deviation (MAD) from the median value of each metric for
all cells. Outliers will be beyond the MAD threshold and we can specify
higher or lower than the threshold.

To identify outliers based on unique genes and counts, we use
log-transformed `nCount_RNA` and `nFeature_RNA` that are more than 3
MADs above and below the median. We will be using the `scater` library
for this.

``` r
library(scater)

qc.nCount_RNA <- isOutlier(pbmc$nCount_RNA, log=TRUE, type="both")
qc.nFeature_RNA  <- isOutlier(pbmc$nFeature_RNA, log=TRUE, type="both")
```

We can see the thresholds that are identified in both QC metric.

``` r
attr(qc.nCount_RNA , "thresholds")
```

    ##     lower    higher 
    ##  802.1223 6012.0706

``` r
attr(qc.nFeature_RNA, "thresholds")
```

    ##     lower    higher 
    ##  399.7497 1665.6823

We can also do the same for `percent.mt`. In this case, we want to
remove cells above the MAD.

``` r
qc.percent.mt <- isOutlier(pbmc$percent.mt,  type="higher")
attr(qc.percent.mt, "thresholds")
```

    ##    lower   higher 
    ##     -Inf 4.436775

Another reason to use adaptive thresholds is if your data contains
multiple batches. In this case, you would detect the QC threshold for
each batch rather than for your entire dataset. It makes little sense to
a single threshold from a data set with samples from multiple batches.
While there are no batches in this current data set, you would need to
include a `batch` parameter when using the `isOutlier` function.

Let’s continue on with the original tutorial and use the thresholds that
were fixed but feel free to try the adaptive thresholds.

``` r
pbmc <- subset(pbmc, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 2500 & percent.mt < 5)
```

<h2>
Normalizing the data
</h2>
After filtering out the low quality cells from the dataset, the next
step is to normalize the data. By default, `Seurat` employs a
global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize” that normalizes the
feature expression measurements for each cell by dividing by the total
expression, multiplies the result by a scale factor (10,000 by default),
and then log-transforms the result to obtain the normalized data.

``` r
pbmc <- NormalizeData(pbmc)
```

It is common to identify highly variable features or genes for
dimensional reduction. By reducing your analysis to the highly variable
genes, you account for most of the biological heterogeneity or factors in
your data and hopefully ignore a majority of the noise while reducing
computational work and time. As such, the highly variable genes should
enable us to isolate the real biological signals.

``` r
pbmc <- FindVariableFeatures(pbmc, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)

# Identify the 10 most highly variable genes
top10 <- head(VariableFeatures(pbmc), 10)

# plot variable features with and without labels
plot1 <- VariableFeaturePlot(pbmc) + theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 6))
plot2 <- LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE) + theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 6))
```

    ## When using repel, set xnudge and ynudge to 0 for optimal results

``` r
plot1 + plot2
```

<h1>
Scaling the data
</h1>
Next, we will need to scale the data. This is a standard pre-processing
step prior dimensional reduction, like PCA, which I discussed in a
previous post.

-   All gene expression will be centered to 0.
-   Scales the expression of each gene to have a variance of 1 so all
    genes have equal contributions

As an additional step, we typically scale the highly variable genes as
these are the genes that will be used for dimensional reductiobn.

``` r
pbmc <- ScaleData(pbmc, features = VariableFeatures(object = pbmc)) #VariableFeatures is used to call the highly variable genes from the object.
```

    ## Centering and scaling data matrix

<h2>
Perform linear dimensional reduction
</h2>
PCA is already built into `Seurat` and can be called the function
`RunPCA`.

``` r
pbmc <- RunPCA(pbmc, features = VariableFeatures(object = pbmc), verbose = FALSE)
# Examine and visualize PCA results a few different ways
print(pbmc[["pca"]], dims = 1:5, nfeatures = 5)
```

    ## PC_ 1 
    ## Positive:  CST3, TYROBP, LST1, AIF1, FTL 
    ## Negative:  MALAT1, LTB, IL32, IL7R, CD2 
    ## PC_ 2 
    ## Positive:  CD79A, MS4A1, TCL1A, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 
    ## Negative:  NKG7, PRF1, CST7, GZMB, GZMA 
    ## PC_ 3 
    ## Positive:  HLA-DQA1, CD79A, CD79B, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPB1 
    ## Negative:  PPBP, PF4, SDPR, SPARC, GNG11 
    ## PC_ 4 
    ## Positive:  HLA-DQA1, CD79B, CD79A, MS4A1, HLA-DQB1 
    ## Negative:  VIM, IL7R, S100A6, IL32, S100A8 
    ## PC_ 5 
    ## Positive:  GZMB, NKG7, S100A8, FGFBP2, GNLY 
    ## Negative:  LTB, IL7R, CKB, VIM, MS4A7

We can visualize the first two prinicpal components.

``` r
DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "pca")
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Seurat-Guided-Clustering-Tutorial_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)

Let’s inspect the contribution of each of the principal components.
Typically only the the principal components containing a majority of the
variance is used. This can be estimated by using an ‘elbow plot’ and
observing where there is a large drop off in variance.

``` r
ElbowPlot(pbmc)
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Seurat-Guided-Clustering-Tutorial_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)

It may be difficult to estimate by visualization so you can use the
second derivative which should find the maximum change in the slope. The
following code should provide another method for estimating the drop
off.

``` r
variance <- pbmc@reductions[["pca"]]@stdev
dy <- -diff(range(variance))
dx <- length(variance) - 1
l2 <- sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)
dx <- dx/l2
dy <- dy/l2
dy0 <- variance - variance[1]
dx0 <- seq_along(variance) - 1
parallel.l2 <- sqrt((dx0 * dx)^2 + (dy0 * dy)^2)
normal.x <- dx0 - dx * parallel.l2
normal.y <- dy0 - dy * parallel.l2
normal.l2 <- sqrt(normal.x^2 + normal.y^2)
below.line <- normal.x < 0 & normal.y < 0
if (!any(below.line)) {
    length(variance)
} else {
    which(below.line)[which.max(normal.l2[below.line])]
}
```

    ## [1] 3

While the largest drop off does occur at PC3, we can see that there in
additional drop off at around PC9-10, suggesting that the majority of
true signal is captured in the first 10 PCs.

<h2>
Cluster the cells
</h2>
To aid in summarizing the data for easier interpretation, scRNA-seq is
often clustered to empirically define groups of cells within the data
that have similar expression profiles. This generates discrete groupings
of cells for the downstream analysis. `Seurat` uses a graph-based
clustering approach. There are additional approaches such as k-means
clustering or hierarchical clustering.

The major advantage of graph-based clustering compared to the other two
methods is its scalability and speed. Simply, `Seurat` first constructs
a KNN graph based on the euclidean distance in PCA space. Each node is a
cell that is connected to its nearest neighbors. Edges, which are the
lines between the neighbors, are weighted based on the similarity
between the cells involved, with higher weight given to cells that are
more closely related. A refinement step (Jaccard similarity) is used to
refine the edge weights between any two cells based on the shared
overlap in their local neighborhoods.

Here we use the first 10 PCs to construct the neighbor graph.

``` r
pbmc <- FindNeighbors(pbmc, dims = 1:10)
```

    ## Computing nearest neighbor graph

    ## Computing SNN

Next, we can apply algorithms to identify “communities” of cells. There
are two main community detection algorithm, [Louvain](https://perso.uclouvain.be/vincent.blondel/research/louvain.html)
and the improved version [Leiden](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41695-z). We
use the default Louvain while controlling the `resolution` parameter to
adjust the number of clusters.

``` r
pbmc <- FindClusters(pbmc, resolution = 0.5)
```

<h2>
Visualization of 2D Embeddsings
</h2>

The high-dimensional space can be embedded in 2D using either tSNE and
UMAP to visualize and explore the datasets. These embeddings attempt to
summarize all of the data using a 2D graph to organize the data to
better interpret the relationships between the cells. Cells that are
more similar to one another should localize within the graph. Different
types of embeddings will relay different information on the relationship
between cells. UMAP is more recommended to be more faithful to the
global connectivity of the manifold than tSNE, while tSNE might preserve
the local structure more.

``` r
# If you haven't installed UMAP, you can do so via reticulate::py_install(packages =
# 'umap-learn')
# Here we generate a UMAP embedding.
pbmc <- RunUMAP(pbmc, dims = 1:10)
```

    ## Warning: The default method for RunUMAP has changed from calling Python UMAP via reticulate to the R-native UWOT using the cosine metric
    ## To use Python UMAP via reticulate, set umap.method to 'umap-learn' and metric to 'correlation'

``` r
# Here we generate a tSNE embedding.
pbmc <- RunTSNE(pbmc, dims = 1:10)
```

We can visualize all three of the dimensional reductions that we
generated. You will notice that UMAP and tSNE generate better
visualizations as they are more adept at interpreting non-linear data.
PCA is linear technique and does not capture the non-linear relationship
of gene expression profiles very well.

``` r
# note that you can set `label = TRUE` or use the LabelClusters function to help label
# individual clusters
plot1 <- DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap")
plot2 <- DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "tsne")
plot3 <- DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "pca")
plot1 +  plot2 + plot3 + plot_layout(nrow = 2)
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Seurat-Guided-Clustering-Tutorial_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)

We can see that cells are clustered closer together while also providing
some global relationship between the clusters within the UMAP embedding.
tSNE generates some similar clusters with the same local relationship
but the global relationship can not be estimated using tSNE. In
addition, tSNE does not scale with larger data sets. The PCA captures
highest variation within the first two PCs but does not include
information from the additional PCs. You can see here the failure of PCA
to resolve the differences between the clusters unlike UMAP and tSNE.

<h2>
Finding Marker Genes
</h2>
To interpret our clusters, we can identify the genes and markers that
drive separation of the clusters. `Seurat` can find these markers via
differential expression. By default, `FindAllMarkers` uses Wilcoxon
rank-sum (Mann-Whitney-U) test to find DEs. You can choose which test by
modifying the `test.use` parameter. If you have blocking factors (i.e.,
batches), you can include it using the `latent.vars` parameter.

``` r
# find markers for every cluster compared to all remaining cells, report only the positive ones
pbmc.markers <- FindAllMarkers(pbmc, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25)
```

You can export the markers as a ‘csv’ for analysis outside of R.

``` r
write.csv(pbmc.markers, 'pbmc.markers.csv')
```

We can visualize some of these markers using `VlnPlot`.

``` r
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "CD79A"))
```

We can visualize the localization of these markers in a UMAP embedding
by using `FeaturePlot`.

``` r
FeaturePlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "GNLY", "CD3E", "CD14", "FCER1A", "FCGR3A", "LYZ", "PPBP", 
    "CD8A"))
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/Seurat-Guided-Clustering-Tutorial_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png)

We can generate a dot plot to visualize the markers.

``` r
DotPlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "GNLY", "CD3E", "CD14", "FCER1A", "FCGR3A", "LYZ", "PPBP", 
    "CD8A")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

Another common method of visualization is to generate a heatmap. We can
use `DoHeatmap` to see the top 10 markers per cluster.

``` r
top10 <- pbmc.markers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 10, wt = avg_logFC)
DoHeatmap(pbmc, features = top10$gene) + NoLegend()
```

    ## Warning in DoHeatmap(pbmc, features = top10$gene): The following features were
    ## omitted as they were not found in the scale.data slot for the RNA assay: CD8A,
    ## VPREB3, TRAT1, PIK3IP1, PRKCQ-AS1, LEF1, NOSIP, CD3E, CD3D, CCR7, LDHB, RPS3A

<h2>
Assigning cell type identity to clusters
</h2>
We can use canonical markers to easily match the unbiased clustering to
known cell types based on the table below:

| Cluster ID | Markers               | Cell Type    |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| 0          | IL7R, CCR7            | Naive CD4+ T |
| 1          | IL7R, S100A4          | Memory CD4+  |
| 2          | CD14, LYZ CD14+       | Mono         |
| 3          | MS4A1                 | B            |
| 4          | CD8A CD8+             | T            |
| 5          | FCGR3A, MS4A7 FCGR3A+ | Mono         |
| 6          | GNLY, NKG7            | NK           |
| 7          | FCER1A, CST3          | DC           |
| 8          | PPBP                  | Platelet     |

``` r
new.cluster.ids <- c("Naive CD4 T", "Memory CD4 T", "CD14+ Mono", "B", "CD8 T", "FCGR3A+ Mono", 
    "NK", "DC", "Platelet")
names(new.cluster.ids) <- levels(pbmc)
pbmc <- RenameIdents(pbmc, new.cluster.ids)
DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.5) + NoLegend()
```

We can also use annotation packages like `SingleR` to perform automatic
annotation. You can find more information
[here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleR.html).
We initialize the Humany Primary Cell Atlas data.

``` r
library(SingleR)
ref <- HumanPrimaryCellAtlasData()
```

We use our `ref` reference to annotate each cell in `pbmc` via the
`SingleR` function.

``` r
pbmc.sce <- as.SingleCellExperiment(pbmc) #convert to SingleCellExperiment
pred.pbmc <- SingleR(test = pbmc.sce, ref = ref, assay.type.test=1,
    labels = ref$label.main)
```

Each row of the output DataFrame contains prediction results for each
cell.

``` r
pred.pbmc
```

Let’s see how it compared to our manual annotations. First, we will add
the predicted labels as new metadata.

``` r
pbmc <- AddMetaData(pbmc, pred.pbmc$labels, col.name = 'SingleR.Annotations')
plot1 <- DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.5) + NoLegend() + ggtitle('Manual Annotations')
plot2 <- DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap", group.by = 'SingleR.Annotations', label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.5) + NoLegend() + ggtitle('SingleR Annotations')
plot1 + plot2
```

We can see that the predicted labels and manually annotated labels match
up pretty well. Your choice of reference data and parameters can be used
to further fine-tine the predicted labels. Here we used a bulk reference
data set but a single-cell reference data that is well-annotated set
could be used as well.

Finally, always make sure to save your data.

``` r
saveRDS(pbmc, file = "pbmc3k_final.rds")
```
